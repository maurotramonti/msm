Welcome to the official repository of MSM!

**Minecraft Server Manager** is a graphical program which is made to help people creating, **customizing and managing** _Minecraft: Java Edition_ multiplayer servers.

The standard procedure could be difficult for people who hasn't experience in computer science, because they have to use the command line (what a strange thing for today's young people!), and they can edit settings only in text configuration files.

### Forget all of this!

 - Choose your preferred version and your favourite software: Vanilla or PaperMC!
 - Read the console and send commands easily!

 - And... take a look at the next part...
