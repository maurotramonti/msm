Welcome to the official repository of MSM!

**Minecraft Server Manager** is a graphical program which is made to help people creating, **customizing and managing** _Minecraft: Java Edition_ multiplayer servers.

The standard procedure could be difficult for people who hasn't experience in computer science, because they have to use the command line (what a strange thing for today's young people!), and they can edit settings only in text configuration files.

### Forget all of this! 

## Implemented features

 - Create and customize your servers with image, players number, difficulty, and all the other options!
 - Choose your preferred version and your favourite software: Vanilla or PaperMC!
 - Read the console and send commands easily!
 - Install your favourite plugins!
 - Take backups of your worlds!
 - And... take a look at the next part...
 
## Features to be implemented

 - More game options
 - More Minecraft versions and softwares
 - Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers
